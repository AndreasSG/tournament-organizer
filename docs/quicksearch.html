About This library facilitates the organization and execution of tournaments. Tournaments can be paired by single elimination, double elimination, round-robin, double round-robin, and Swiss. If round-robin, double round-robin, or Swiss are chosen, then a single elimination or double elimination playoffs can follow. For Swiss and round-robin tournaments, the following tiebreakers systems are supported: Buchholz Cut 1 Solkoff (Buchholz) Median-Buchholz Sonneborn-Berger (Neustadtl) Baumbach (Most Wins) Cumulative (and Cumulative Opponent's) Versus Magic TCG Opponent's match win percentage Game win percentage Opponent's game win percentage Pokemon TCG Opponent's match win percentage Opponent's opponent's match win percentage Installation npm install tournament-organizer Basic Usage TODO Implementations TODO Contributing Please only submit an issue if you encounter a bug or have a feature suggestion. If you are interested, please feel free to fork and clone the repository (on main branch), then submit a pull request. I am a high school teacher, and would appreciate any and all support in continuing this project. × Search results Close "},"Algorithms.html":{"id":"Algorithms.html","title":"Namespace: Algorithms","body":" Tournament Organizer Namespaces AlgorithmsUtilities Classes EventManagerMatchPairingsPlayerTournament Namespace: Algorithms Algorithms Pairing algorithms.
